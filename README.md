# Traffic-Simulation

The main purpose of the project is to create a circuit and make cars and buses drive around the circuit by driving and obeying traffic rules. All vehicles stop at a red light and go at a green light and do not crash each other.

Cars turn randomly at crossroads and busses choose the shortest distance between the next bus stop.

 A preview of the simulation is given below.
